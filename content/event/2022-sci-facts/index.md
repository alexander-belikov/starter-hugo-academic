abstract: "The ever-increasing amount of published academic results poses a
challenge in interpretation and validation of these publications and
rendering them to scientific facts. Despite the apparent lack of
alignment between published claims and established facts, accounting
for network structure enables predictive models that can assess the
validity of published claims. Using pre-trained models on simulated
alternative attention and local clustering distributions (which
translates to modifications of funding policies) of academic
publication we show that the overall knowledge of facts may be
dramatically improved. We conclude by a discussion of applications of
our methodology to other domains."
